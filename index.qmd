**The power of numeric evidence in science communication**

> Challenges exist in presenting numeric information in science communication. For example, public innumeracy—and experts’ concerns about providing numbers—suggest not showing them. On the other hand, people often prefer getting them and their provision can increase comprehension, trust, engagement, and healthy behaviors while reducing risk overestimates and supporting decision-maker autonomy. Presenting numeric facts without considering their comprehensibility and usability though is like throwing good money after bad. Thus, we’ll briefly examine three general strategies for nurturing comprehension and use of numbers in other persons.

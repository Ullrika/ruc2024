Knight Chair, Director, Center for Science Communication Research, University of Oregon, USA\nThe power of numeric evidence in science communication\n\nChallenges exist in presenting numeric information in science communication. For example, public innumeracy—and experts’ concerns about providing numbers—suggest not showing them. On the other hand, people often prefer getting them and their provision can increase comprehension, trust, engagement, and healthy behaviors while reducing risk overestimates and supporting decision-maker autonomy. Presenting numeric facts without considering their comprehensibility and usability though is like throwing good money after bad. Thus, we’ll briefly examine three general strategies for nurturing comprehension and use of numbers in other persons.\n\nProfessor Danielle Timmermans, Professor in Public Health Risk Communication, Amsterdam Public Health research institute, The Netherlands\nCommunicating uncertainties about scientific evidence and health risks to the public during the COVID19 pandemic: a good idea?\n\nDespite major uncertainties at the beginning of the COVID19 pandemic, communications to the public in the Netherlands often lacked references to the uncertainty of scientific knowledge about e.g. the contagiousness of the virus. Only later in the pandemic did politicians and experts more often mention the associated risks and uncertainties. This may have to do with the perception of politicians and experts that the public cannot deal with uncertainties and therefore they played down the uncertainty. Furthermore, uncertainty about scientific evidence may not have been relevant to policy decisions on measures to control the pandemic at specific phases of the pandemic. I will discuss the results of our recent interview study with Dutch policymakers, scientific experts and communications professionals involved in advising politicians on how to deal with the pandemic.\n\nJoseph Kadane, the Leonard J.

Knight Chair, Director, Center for Science Communication Research, University of Oregon, USA\nThe power of numeric evidence in science communication\n\nChallenges exist in presenting numeric information in science communication. For example, public innumeracy—and experts’ concerns about providing numbers—suggest not showing them. On the other hand, people often prefer getting them and their provision can increase comprehension, trust, engagement, and healthy behaviors while reducing risk overestimates and supporting decision-maker autonomy. Presenting numeric facts without considering their comprehensibility and usability though is like throwing good money after bad. Thus, we’ll briefly examine three general strategies for nurturing comprehension and use of numbers in other persons.\n\nProfessor Danielle Timmermans, Professor in Public Health Risk Communication, Amsterdam Public Health research institute, The Netherlands\nKeynote 3 TBC\n\n\n\nOrganisers\n\n\nCentre for Environmental and Climate Science, Lund University (Dr Ullrika Sahlin)\nDepartment of Philosophy, Lund University (Professor Johannes Persson)\nMedical Ethics, Lund University (Professor Nils-Eric Sahlin)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepartment of Geography, King’s College London (Professor Ragnar Löfstedt)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunding\nJournal of Risk Research"

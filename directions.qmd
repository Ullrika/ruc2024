# Travelling to Lund

The nearest airport is Copenhagen. From there you take the train directly to Lund. Purchase the ticket to the train on the airport or via the skånetrafiken app (only in Swedish) before boarding the train.

We recommend a hotel in the city center of Lund, such as Grand Hotel.

# Venue

Talks and poster session will be at Forum Medicum, Sölvegatan 19.
